This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

quick app created with Create React App:
## Setup:
1. clone repository
2. npm install
3. npm start

this is very crude code, just wanted to display that i can be functional in react with redux. with more time i would prioritize
1. tests
2. better html/css it is quite ugly and unrefined, but decent for a day's work
3. tabs over spaces. didn't want to take the time to make this adjustment.
4. code comments
5. could do a better job typing things
